Description: This package provides a simple interface for expanding upon the
    `formula` class by introducing additional attributes, such as specific
    roles, labels, and groups to individual terms. This allows for formulas to 
    be expanded and to create families of formulas that are related, using 
    formula lists. This is driven by the need for more clear and intentional
    relationship descriptions, particularly in the causal modeling space.
