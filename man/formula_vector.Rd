\usage{
formula_vctr(x = term_rcrd(), ...)

\method{formula_vctr}{term_rcrd}(
  x = term_rcrd(),
  roles = list(),
  groups = list(),
  pattern = character(),
  ...
)

\method{formula_vctr}{default}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Objects of the following types can be used as inputs
\itemize{
\item \code{term_rcrd}
}}

\item{...}{Arguments to be passed to or from other methods}

\item{roles}{Specific roles the variable plays within the formula. These are
of particular importance, as they serve as special terms that can effect
how a formula is interpreted. The options for roles are as below:
\itemize{
\item \strong{exposure} or \code{X(...)}: a predictor variable that serves as a primary
or key variable in the \eqn{Exposure ~ Outcome} relationship
}

Formulas can be condensed by applying their specific role to individual
terms as a function/wrapper. For example, \code{y ~ X(x1) + x2 + x3}. This would
signify that \code{x1} has the specific role of an exposure.}

\item{groups}{List of formulas that have the term (or terms) on the LHS and
the group name on the RHS (quotations to indicate character value not
necessary). E.g. \code{list(c(x1, x2) ~ grp)}}
}

This function defines a new modified \code{formula} class that has been
vectorized. It expands upon the functionality of formulas.
