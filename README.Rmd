<!-- badges: end -->

_Formulas with Operations Prescribed_ are described within the `{forks}` package, $/f…îrks/$, which helps to extend the base R `formula` class.

## Installation

You can install the released version of `forks` from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r}
#install.packages("forks")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("asshah4/forks")
```

## Usage

The `forks` package is simple, and only has several major functions.

- `rx()`
- `set_rx_labels()`

It simply adds a layer of attributes to `formula` objects that can help simplify their usage in other packages, particularly in the field of epidemiology and causality-based modeling.

```{r}
library(rx)
# Create a simple formula
f <- mpg ~ wt + hp + cyl
new_f <- rx(f)
class(new_f)

# Identifies the roles of individual terms
term_tbl <- attributes(new_f)$roles

# These can also be listed out as labels if need be
table_to_list(term_tbl)
```

For other purposes, the individual terms may need to be labeled. For example, in the `murmur` package, exposures and fixed variables are treated differently.

```{r}
# This can be done manually
set_rx_labels(labels = list(
	X = "exposures",
	F = "fixed"
))

f <- mpg ~ X(wt) + hp + F(cyl)
new_f <- rx(f)

# Identifies the roles of individual terms
attributes(new_f)$roles %>%
	table_to_list()

# This can also be done through "themes" based on individual packages
reset_rx_labels()
set_rx_theme("murmur")
f <- mpg ~ X(wt) + hp + F(cyl)
new_f <- rx(f)
attributes(new_f)$roles %>%
	table_to_list()
```
